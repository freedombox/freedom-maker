- initial boot configuration improvements, as there are a few things we
  really do want to defer to first boot, or at least make it trivial to
  fix up per-system
	- ssh host keys
	- root password
- add Sheeva as a build target
- add x86 virtualized as a build target (use vmdebootstrap?)
- investigate and integrate software components that looks interesting
	- channel-server, the buddycloud channels service for XMPP
	- babeld, loop-free distance-vector routing protocol
	- tahoe-lafs, secure distributed filesystem
- virtualbox should build with dreamplug configuration

*** stuff to do for first feature release ***

  - pre-configured user interface
	- DHCP and HTTP servers on eth0 and/or eth1
	- plinth-based initial config interface

  - freedom buddy installed
  - openvpn server setup
  - the privoxy fork configured as a transparent proxy
  - plinth configured to at display these config details and to control
    whatever is feasible
